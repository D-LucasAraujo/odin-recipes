    <li> 1 1/2 c.sugar </li>
    <li>1/4 tsp.salt</li>
    <li> 3 c.whole milk </li>
    <li> 4 whole egg yolks </li>

    <li> 2 tsp.vanilla extract </li>
    <li>tbsp.butter</li>
    <li>Whipped cream, for serving</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions - Step by Step</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Combine the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium saucepan. Stir or whisk together.</li>
    <li>Pour in milk and egg yolks, and whisk together.</li>
    <li>Stir over medium heat until the mixture just barely comes to a boil and becomes thick, about 6-8 minutes (maybe less, maybe more; just watch it!) The second it starts to bubble and thicken (note: It should be thick like pudding!) remove it from the heat. Add the chocolate, vanilla, and butter, and stir until everything is beautifully combined.</li>
    <li>Pour the pudding into the pie crust (if there is extra, spoon it into small dishes) and place in the fridge to chill for 4 hours uncovered.</li>
    <li>Cut into slices and serve with whipped cream! </li>
