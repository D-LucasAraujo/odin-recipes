    <h1>The most crunchy French Fries</h1>

<h3>Ingridients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>2 large potatoes</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions - Step by Step</h3>

<ol>
    <li><p>First the potatoes. Rinse well in water and then peel the potato.</p></li>
    <p><strong>TIP</strong>: Peeling the potato is optional. While I know some people like the skin on their french fries, I find that it creates a tough exterior. I personally prefer my finger chips to be bare and tender.</p>
    <li><p>slice the potato in slices having 1 cm thickness. Before slicing, you can remove the top and bottom part of the potato to get a square or rectangle shaped potato.</p></li>
    <p><strong>TIP</strong>: If you are planning on making french fries at home often, there is actually a device called a french fry cutter that will do steps 2-4 for you! That said, I don’t have space in my kitchen for a tool that only achieves one end. Using a knife and cutting board takes a few extra minutes, but isn’t difficult.</p>
    <li><p>Cut the potatoes in sticks having 1 cm width.</p></li>
    <li><p>Cut the remaining potato slices in sticks as well.</p></li>
    <li><p>Rinse these potato sticks for a couple of times in water. Add the rinsed potatoes to a bowl and submerge them in cold water for 30-45 minutes to remove extra starch.</p></li>
    <p><strong>TIP</strong>:In a hot and humid climate, keep the bowl in the fridge. For extra crispy fries, soak potatoes in salt water instead.</p>
    <li><p>After 30 minutes or 45 minutes, drain the potatoes in a colander.</p></li>
    <li><p>the potatoes with running water. Drain all the extra water.</p></li>
    <li><p>Then place them on a clean kitchen cotton napkin.</p></li>
    <li><p>Fold the napkin over to press, pat and dry the potatoes. The potatoes have to be completely dried before you begin to fry them.</p></li>
    <li><p>Heat oil in a wok or pan over medium or medium-low heat, depending on the heaviness of your pan.For a heavy pan or wok, keep medium flame and for a less heavy pan, use a medium-low flame. The oil should reach a temperature of 130 to 135 degrees celsius (275 degrees Fahrenheit).</p></li>
    <li><p>Stir in intervals while frying them for uniform cooking.</p></li>
    <li><p>Fry/blanch in oil for about 3 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked, but not brown from outside. They should just get a crust from outside without any major color change. Light browning of the edges is fine. Remove with a slotted spoon.</p></li>
